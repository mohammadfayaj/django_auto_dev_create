#### This is a repository of Python scripts that can be used for creating Auto Django project. Here are some features of this repository:
### The script will add some feature that ```Django default``` doesn't provide such as:-

```
import os
------

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ----------
    "test_app",
]


TEMPLATES = [
    ----------
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
    ----------
]

STATIC_ROOT = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),)
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
STATIC_URL = "static/"

```

- The script will create `templates` and `static` folder
- & also create `forms.py`, `urls.py`


```
# example modified urls.py

from django.urls import path 
from .views import * 
  
app_name = 'test_app'
 
urlpatterns = [ 
 path('', home, name='home'), 
]


# example modified views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse 
from django.shortcuts import render 
 
# Create your views here. 
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1 style='text-align: center; margin-top: 10rem;'>Everything Good!</h1>") 

```


- #### The scripts are written in Python 3+ and use standard libraries such as `subprocess`, `os`, `shutil`, and `pathlib`.
- #### It can be executed from the command line or just double click on the `execute_django_dev_create.cmd`.
